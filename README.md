# Deep Learning In Production Course

In this article series, our goal is dead simple. We are gonna start with a colab notebook containing prototype deep learning code (i.e. a research project) and we’re gonna deploy and scale it to serve millions or billions (ok maybe I’m overexcited) of users.

We will incrementally explore the following concepts and ideas:

- How to structure and develop production-ready machine learning code,

- How to optimize the model’s performance and memory requirements, and

- How to make it available to the public by setting up a small server on the cloud.

But that’s not all of it. Afterwards, we need to scale our server to be able to handle the traffic as the userbase grows and grows.

In this repo, you can find the full code provided in every article. Note that the code for each lesson is selft contained and can be run independently.
